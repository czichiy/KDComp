# KDComp

KDComp is a MATLAB project designed for computing kernel dictionaries and related matrices used in signal processing. The project includes functions for calculating kernel dictionaries (KD), RkkD matrices, TD matrices, and a testing script to evaluate the performance of these computations.


## Files Overview

### file 1. CalculateKD

This function computes the KD matrix.  
```sh
KD = CalculateKD(Dic, Nd, sigma, Ruu)

Dic: Dictionary matrix.
Nd: Dimension of the dictionary.
sigma: Standard deviation.
Ruu: Autocorrelation matrix.
```
